The augmented dataset was created based on the Fatlim dataset (Papuga et al., 2022).
The original dataset is available at the following link: https://www.pragtic.com/fatlim.php

Before running the program, ensure you have the following:

Python installed, reccommend Python 3.10.x.
PyTorch and NumPy libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands in terminal or command prompt.
"pip install torch numpy"

A pre-trained model exp_model.pth (this file should be located in the same directory as the Python script).

Running the Program

Download the Python script (cpu_model_1.py) and ensure the pre-trained model file (exp_model.pth) is in the same directory as the script.
Run the Python Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are stored.
Run the script by typing:

"python cpu_model_1.py"


Input Features:
Depending on your choice, you will be prompted to enter a set of material properties. For example:
Choice 1: You will need to enter all features (e.g. stress tensor, Rm, Re) and the experimental data (e.g. f0, t-1, t0).
Choice 2: You will need to enter only the base features (e.g. stress tensor, Rm, Re). The program will estimate f0, t-1, and t0.
